# aarpack
Android Library (*.aar) zipper/uploader

AAR pack lets you easily transport dependencies. No more having to upload to Maven Central or jCenter, simply run the command below from the root of your project, and all of your dependencies will be packaged into a zip and uploaded to the cloud. Simply give this link to your friend, and then can pull the zip right down, unpack it, and start using your library/libraries.

```
# From your Android Project root
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/farazfazli/aarpack/master/aarpack.sh | sh
```
